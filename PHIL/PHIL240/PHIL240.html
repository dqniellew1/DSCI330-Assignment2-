Examines basic issues in the philosophy of science such as the testing of hypotheses, the construction and confirmation of theories, the nature of scientific explanation and the concept of laws of nature. The course also investigates the distinction between science and pseudoscience, and asks to what extent each of these has driven recent policy on environment issues and school curricula. Offered each year. Meets GOAL 6 (Humanities).
